# 100 - Who is a DevOps Engineer?

Organizations trying to practice DevOps requires people with collaborative skills. Also, they should be willing to change and adopt new technologies. They are DevOps Engineers.

From a tooling perspective, a DevOps Engineer is someone who has a good understanding of systems, automation tools, CI tools, Version control systems, networking, experience in using project management tools. It paves the way for DevOps adoption.

I have seen teams babysitting pipeline jobs for the infra/app build and release process. In the world of DevOps Engineers, the design or the automated CI/CD pipeline designed/developed by the team should also deliver small updates or releases without much manual intervention. It happens only if there is a cultural shift in the way teams work.

For example, what I can say from my experience as a DevOps Engineer is, sitting with different teams and having an open conversation on pain points will solve many problems than plainly following a team-wise rule-book. (And trust me, it is not easy as it sounds ðŸ™‚ )

Another goal of DevOps engineers is to automate repeated tasks and spend more time on engineering and innovation.
