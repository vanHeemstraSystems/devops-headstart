# 1000 - Understand Security Best Practices (DevSecOps)

DevSecOps is another area dealing with integrating security practices in each stage of DevOps.

Wikipedia says,

```
DevSecOps is an augmentation of DevOps to allow for security practices to be integrated into the DevOps approach. 
The traditional centralized security team model must adopt a federated model allowing each delivery team 
the ability to factor in the correct security controls into their DevOps practices.
```

Checkpoints [2020 security survey](https://pages.checkpoint.com/cyber-security-report-2020-MOVED.html) shows different cyber attacks by region.

In cloud environments, crypto mining is one of the common attacks. This mostly happens when the cloud access secrets are maintained poorly so that hackers get access to it.

When it comes to DevOps, [secret management](https://devopscube.com/setup-hashicorp-vault-beginners-guide/) for applications and infrastructure components should follow standard security practices.

The following image shows the key DevSecOps standard practices [published by Redhat](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-devsecops).

Hashicorp Vault is a great secret management tool you can look at. There are many workflows available to manage environment secrets.
