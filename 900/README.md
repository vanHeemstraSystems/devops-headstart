# 900 - Logging & Monitoring

Logging and monitoring are fundamental aspects of an infrastructure.

Most of the apps deployed in the infrastructure will produce logs and metrics. Based on architecture and design, logs are pushed and stored in a logging infrastructure.

Every company will have a logging and monitoring infrastructure. Commonly used logging stacks are **Splunk** and **ELK**. Also, there are few SaaS companies like Loggly, which provide logging infrastructure.

For monitoring, there are open source tools like [Prometheus](https://devopscube.com/setup-prometheus-monitoring-on-kubernetes/), Nagios and enterprise tools like AppDynamics, [Datadog](https://devopscube.com/cloud-based-docker-container-monitoring/), SignalFx, etc. Check out our blog on the [best open source monitoring tools](https://devopscube.com/best-opensource-monitoring-tools/).

Developers, operations teams, and security teams use logging systems to monitor, troubleshoot, and audit applications and infrastructure. Also, for AIOPS, log data plays a key role.

In every organization, mission-critical applications are **monitored 24/7** using **monitoring dashboards**. Generally, dashboards use data from logging sources or metrics generated by the application.

Also, there will be alerting systems that use the rules configured in the monitoring systems for alerting.

For example, an alert could be triggered as a slack notification, Jira ticket, email alert, [ServiceNow incident ticket](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/orlando-it-service-management/page/product/incident-management/concept/c_IncidentManagement.html), or xMatters phone call. Alerting workflows differ from organization to organization.

As a DevOps engineer, you should be able to query logs and troubleshoot issues in non-prod and prod environments. Understand regular expressions is very important to query logs in any logging tool.
