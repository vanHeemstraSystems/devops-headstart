# 500 - Understand How Infrastructure Components Work

The basic building block of any organization is its Infrastructure. It could be on the cloud or on-premise Data Center.

An overall understanding of Infrastructure components is a must for a person who wants to practice or work in a DevOps environment. For example, when you get into meetings with network/security teams, with a fair amount of infrastructure knowledge you can ask the right questions, understand what they are saying and collaborate better.

There is a big difference when you say “It’s not working, can you look into this” and “Hey, I have done my initial troubleshooting, and here are my findings. Can you look into you further and help us understand what’s causing the issue”

You should spend some time and have a basic understanding of the following.

| Networking |
| --- |
| Subnets |
| Public network |
| Private network |
| CIDR Notations |
| Static/Dynamic IP’s |
| Firewall |
| Proxy |
| NAT |
| Public & Private DNS |
| Troubleshooting |
| VPN |



There could be more things, but I have highlighted the critical components in an IT Infrastructure.
