# 800 - Containers, Distributed Systems & Service Mesh

Container adoption is increasing day by day. The organization you work for might not be using containers now. However, it is best to have hands-on knowledge of container technology like Docker or podman. It will gain you some competitive edge among your peers.

Once you [understand docker](https://devopscube.com/what-is-docker/), you can start learning about [container orchestration tools](https://devopscube.com/docker-container-clustering-tools/) like [Kubernetes](https://devopscube.com/kubernetes-tutorials-beginners/), Docker Swarm, etc.

These platforms are best suited for microservices-based architecture.

Here is an interesting Kubernetes usage trend by [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/container-report/).

The following image shows the five-year increasing search trends for Kubernetes.

Also, many engineers are showing interest in learning kubernetes. 2021 will see many engineers getting certified in kubernetes. You can check out our [CKA](https://devopscube.com/cka-exam-study-guide/), [CKAD](https://devopscube.com/ckad-exam-study-guide/), and [CKS](https://devopscube.com/cks-exam-guide-tips/) exam guides.

[Service mesh](https://devopscube.com/istio-opensource-platform-microservices-management/) is an advanced topic in the container space. If you are a beginner to container toolsets, you can learn this after gaining a good amount of knowledge in container orchestration and microservices-based architecture. There are many service mesh tools from the CNCF foundation. You can take a look at the [best service mesh tools](https://devopscube.com/service-mesh-tools/) for microservices.
