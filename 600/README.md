# 600 - Get Certified On Cloud

When I say “Get Certified,” ***please do not use the exam dumps*** to pass the certification. It adds significantly less value to you. It may be useful for the organization to show the clients that they have certified cloud engineers.

Most of the public cloud market share is currently owned by AWS. Here is the [report from Businesswire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171214006289/en/Cloud-Competition-Intensifies---Rapid-Growth-Microsoft).

Pick any one public cloud, preferably AWS, and learn about all its core infrastructure services. Do hands-on on all the core services and understand how it works.

Watch [AWS re-invent videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=AWS+reinvent) and understand how other organizations are using AWS services for hosting their applications.

Trust me, you will learn a lot from these videos, and no online training will provide that much information on how to run production workloads on AWS.

If you are planning to get certified GCP, watch their [Google Next](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=google+next) videos.

Use the certification to gauge yourself on the respective platform.
