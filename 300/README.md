# 300 - Understand DevOps Culture

To become a DevOps engineer, the first and foremost thing is to understand the ***DevOps culture***. It is all about different teams working together towards a common goal. In other words, there should not be any blaming culture between different IT teams.

The following image says it all.

For example, If you are a devops engineer, never say “It’s not my job”, Say, “Let me see what I can do to help.” How you respond has a significant impact on collaboration. (It doesn’t mean you have to spoon-feed people and do others’ work.)

```
Note: If you are fresher, understanding cultural aspects is challenging 
because it comes with actual industry experience. 
So my advice would be to focus on core IT fundamentals 
(infrastructure and programming)
```

IT leaders and decision-makers should ensure the entire team is mentored on DevOps cultural aspects before getting into DevOps toolsets. It avoids lots of confusion in the group. It usually doesn’t happen in organizations, and they end up having a “***DevOps Team***” for operations, which again ends up in a siloed structure.

People would stop hiding the truth and stop blaming others for project issues once they understand that an issue in project delivery has to be addressed in a collaborative manner than pointing fingers. For example, a [blameless postmortem](https://sre.google/sre-book/postmortem-culture/).

Once you understand the DevOps culture, you would stop saying that “***CI/CD and automation is DevOps.***”

I would suggest reading the state of the [DevOps report by puppet](https://puppet.com/resources/report/2021-state-of-devops-report/). must-read devops report for engineers and leaders.
