# 1100 - Learn Coding & Scripting

Scripting is essential for a DevOps Engineer. You will end up using scripts in the CI/CD workflow. You can learn the following commonly used scripting languages. You can check out my article on [shell scripting for DevOps](https://devopscube.com/linux-shell-scripting-for-devops/) to know more about it.

1. Bash/Shell
2. Python

To become a true devops engineer, you need to **understand the Developers’ world better**. To do that, you need to know how a typical development process works.

So it is essential to have a good understanding of programming, APIs, etc. It will help you troubleshoot and collaborate better.

My suggestion is to pick a programming language and build an application from scratch. When I started my career, I built an entire ruby on rails web application from scratch. Even though development was not my main work, till today it has helped me in understanding many concepts in the developer’s world.

When you develop an application, you will understand the process and components involved in application development. Once you know this, you can effectively interact with developers and other teams.

Also, In today’s world, we treat everything as code. Even though there are enough tools to automate everything, you might need custom functionality that a tool may not offer. In such cases, coding/scripting comes in handy to achieve those functionalities.

For example,

1. [Jenkins pipeline as code requires an understanding of groovy](https://devopscube.com/jenkins-pipeline-as-code/)
2. Ansible custom module requires an understanding of python
3. Writing Kubernetes operator requires Golang experience.

Also, if you look at [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) or IaaC tool like [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/), you can use a programming language to define the infrastructure and do test-driven infrastructure development like you develop applications.

Golang is really getting popular in the DevOps domain. Lots of DevOps tooling are done using Golang nowadays. In fact, tools like Kubernetes, terraform are written in go.

JFrog surveyed Golang adoption during GopherCon, and 18% of the respondents said they use Golang for DevOps-related work.
