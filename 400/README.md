# 400 - Learn about *nix Systems

We are in an era where we cannot live without Linux/Unix systems. You should get a better understanding and working knowledge of various Linux distributions highly used by organizations (RHEL, Centos, Ubuntu, CoreOS, etc.).

As per [The Linux foundation case study](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects/case-studies/), 90% of the public cloud workload runs on Linux.

Here is another interesting study from Redhat, which shows the different Linux distros used in the public cloud.

Now you have enough reasons why you should focus on Linux.

When it comes to Linux, itâ€™s all terminal, GUI is less preferred in *nix world. Get your hands dirty with terminals of these systems.

You can use a [Virtual box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) with Vagrant or AWS/GCP/Azure to spin up Linux servers.

You can start with the following.

1. Understand the Linux booting process
2. Install and Configure web servers (Apache, Nginx, Tomcat, etc..) and learn how web servers work.
3. Learn how Linux processes work.
4. Learn how SSH works.
5. Learn about different file systems.
6. Learn how volumes work in Linux.
7. Learn about system logging, monitoring, and troubleshooting.
8. Learn about important protocols (SSL, TLS, TCP, UDP, FTP, SFTP, SCP, SSH)
9. Learn to manage services and try to create a service on your own (Initd, Systemd)
10. Host static/Dynamic websites on web servers and play around with different confgurations.
11. Setup Load balancers & Reverse Proxys (Nginx, HA proxy, etc). Understand each configuration and algortithms behind load balancing.
12. Learn to optimize Linux perfomance.
13. Break something and learn to troubleshoot.
