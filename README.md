# DevOps - Headstart

Based on "Become A DevOps Engineer in 2022: A Comprehensive Guide" at https://devopscube.com/become-devops-engineer/

In this comprehensive guide, I have shared my DevOps Engineer experiences in different organizations and tips to become a DevOps Egnineer.

As for the current IT market, the DevOps domain is one of the best options for IT folks’ salary and career growth. One common question I get quite often is, “How to become a DevOps engineer?“

Many people argue (including me) that there is nothing like a “DevOps Engineer” or a “DevOps Team” because it is not a thing. However, everyone in the industry now got used to the term “DevOps engineer, ” and as long as you understand the DevOps philosophy, these titles don’t matter much.

Towards the end of the article, I have added the different teams a DevOps engineer can be part of.

There are many misconceptions about what DevOps really means. One such misconception is “Automation is DevOps.” Developing skills related to infrastructure automation is not enough to become a DevOps Engineer.

Wikipedia says,

```
DevOps (a clipped compound of development and operations) is a culture, movement or practice that emphasizes 
the collaboration and communication of both software developers and other information-technology (IT) professionals 
while automating the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes.
```

From the above definition, it is clear that DevOps is not about any tools or technologies. It is a philosophy for making different IT teams (Developers, Platforms teams, QA, Performance, etc) work together to deliver better and fast results through continuous feedback.

Here is an interesting trend graph showing DevOp’s popularity in the last five years.
