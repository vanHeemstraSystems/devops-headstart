# 1200 - Learn Git, Learn to Document, Learn about GitOps

It is essential to version control everything you do (except passwords and secrets :P). Git is the best version control tool. There are plenty of tutorials available on git, and it will not take much time to learn important git operations.

You can start with Github or Bitbucket as your remote code repository.

```
Note: Git Branching strategy is an important aspect of any application release process.
```

Once you understand Git, learn about GitOps.

So what is this GitOps anyway? here is what [gitops.tech](https://www.gitops.tech/) explains GitOps

```
GitOps is a way of implementing Continuous Deployment for cloud native applications. 
It focuses on a developer-centric experience when operating infrastructure, 
by using tools developers are already familiar with, 
including Git and Continuous Deployment tools.
```

You can read my [explanation on Gitops](https://devopslearners.com/what-is-gitops-168aac9a2ee).

The next important thing is to document every important thing you do. Every repository must have a README file, which should explain your code in a better way. Good documentation will help not only you but also someone who tries to use your code.
